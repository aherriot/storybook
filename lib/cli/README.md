# Storybook CLI

Storybook CLI (*Command Line Interface*) is the easiest way to add [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to your project.

In the future it will also add other useful generators and migration tooling.

## [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) support

It also supports yarn.
If you have installed yarn in your system, it'll detect it and use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

If you don't want to use `yarn` always you can use the `--use-npm` option like this:

```sh
storybook init --use-npm
```

## [Flow](https://flow.org/) support

It also supports flow files. By default, [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), the tool used to transform the source files, uses babel to read the files. To be able to transform any flow annotated file, you need to use the flow parser.

```sh
storybook init --parser flow
```
