    Welcome to storybook
  </h1>
  <p>
    This is a UI component dev environment for your app.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've added some basic stories inside the 
    <code
      className="css-1rxzob2 ensbfgf3"
    >
      src/stories
    </code>
     directory.
    <br />
    A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
    <br />
    (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
  </p>
  <p>
    See these sample 
    <button
      className="css-1otf2jm ensbfgf5"
      onClick={[Function]}
    >
      stories
    </button>
     for a component called
     
    <code
      className="css-1rxzob2 ensbfgf3"
    >
      Button
    </code>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like that, you can add your own components as stories.
    <br />
    You can also edit those components and see changes right away.
    <br />
    (Try editing the 
    <code
      className="css-1rxzob2 ensbfgf3"
    >
      Button
    </code>
     stories located at
     
    <code
      className="css-1rxzob2 ensbfgf3"
    >
      src/stories/index.js
    </code>
    .)
  </p>
  <p>
    Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.
    <br />
    Have a look at the
     
    <a
      className="css-4d3lbr ensbfgf4"
      href="https://storybook.js.org/basics/writing-stories"
